# Infection simulation

A simple model of viral infection.

Bounce 100 balls and when an infected ball strikes another it is infected.

A recovery time is set, and once recovered an infected subject can no longer be infected or infect another.

Assumes no other consequence of infection, i.e. all infected will recover and be immune forever.

## Exercises -

* Run the program a few times and note that the results change each time

* Read the code and try changing some of the values

* Add a user interface - e.g. buttons for "start", "print report", "quit"

* Add new features, e.g. dd a "lockdown feature" where (most) people move more slowly.

* Print a graph of the report results.

* Any other features you can think of.
