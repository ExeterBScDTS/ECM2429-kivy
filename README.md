# ECM2429-kivy

Python application examples using Kivy.

There are three exercises to complete.

## Lesson 1

Install Kivy and check it is working correctly. If all goes well, this shouldn't take long, but don't be afraid to ask for help.

## Lesson 2

This is a working example, but you are encouraged to follow the instructions at <https://kivy.org/doc/stable/tutorials/pong.html>

Take time to read the code and understand how it works.

## Lesson 3

Use this as a starting point for your own user interface design.   Trying building a form that requires a name, email address, and password.   How would you add checks to enure that the passwords is secure, e.g. 8 to 12 characters with at least 1 digit and a symbol?
